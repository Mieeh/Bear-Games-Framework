snake_case
camelCase
PascalCase = UpperCamelCase

Naming Conventions:
For .cpp and .h files use snake case, example: window_framework.h & window_framework.cpp
In .h files ->
- namespaces should always be one word lower cased, example: bear::sound::
- classes uses camel case, example: WindowFramework & Rendeable 
- structs should use the same naming as classes
- enumerators should always use snake case same as .cpp & .h files, example: context_settings_option::
Members of a class ->
- private members uses m_ prefix and the member name uses upper camel case, example: m_UniformMap
- for public methods use lower camel case, example: void setColor(...), bool isUniformLive(...)
